### Cassiapp Externals

These are externally compiled components of [Cassiapp](https://github.com/cassia-org/cassiapp), unlike Cassia runtimes they aren't user-replaceable and are supposed to be tied to a specific version of the app.

#### Building
* Run `apply-patches.py` in the `deps` folder to patch the dependencies
* Run `build.sh` to build cassiaext
